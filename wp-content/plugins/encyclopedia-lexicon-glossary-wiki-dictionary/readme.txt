= Limitations of the lite version =
The most features are available but you cannot select every option. You will find a small notice for each unavailable option on the settings page. The maximal number of encyclopedia items is limited to twelve.


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =
* WordPress 4.6 or greater
* PHP version 5.5.38 or greater; PHP 7 is recommended
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater

= Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you do not need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Encyclopedia, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Encyclopedia" and click "Search Plugins". Once you have found my plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install now".

= Manual installation =
The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =
Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I embed the archive page in my website? =
Go to Design -> Menus and open the Encyclopedia box. Switch to the "View All" tab. There you can find the index page you can add to the menu of your choice.

= How do I create relations between my Encyclopedia items? =
To create relations between your items you need to classify your items by using tags.

= Can Encyclopedia display and sort items in other than Latin characters? =
Yes, Encyclopedia can handle every existing character. All strings are handled as UTF-8. So it works for Arabian, Russian, Chinese, Turkish, and all other UTF-8 compliant languages.

= Is it possible to search for Encyclopedia items only? =
Yes, it is. For this purpose place the "Encyclopedia Search" Widget in a sidebar of your choice. The search result will display Encyclopedia items only.

= What can I do when I have problems with installing or setting up the Encyclopedia? =
First of all read the installation guide on this site. Follow the guide step by step. If you do so and still have problems, there could be an incompatibility with another plugin: Deactivate all other plugins, try to install/set up Encyclopedia again. If it works re-activate plugin by plugin again to see which one causes the problem. If you need personal assistance or coaching or if you want us to install and set up Encyclopedia on your website, please contact us via [support form](http://dennishoppe.de/en/support) on our website (this is a business service and you need to buy the support package to make use of it).

= Does Encyclopedia display tool tips when hovering linked items in my contents? =
Maybe: The linked encyclopedia items have a title tag which displays the excerpt of the description. If you hover it with your mouse you can see it. If your theme supports tool tips it will show the description as tool tip. If you need this implemented please use our [support form](http://dennishoppe.de/en/support).
